Murray is a package that enables incrementality testing, allowing you to generate a heatmap of Minimum Detectable Effects (MDE) across different configurations of holdouts and periods. This provides a comprehensive view and simplifies the selection of optimal treatment states. Additionally, Murray allows you to generate impact graphs and metrics for the constructed counterfactual.
