Murray's methodology is based on constructing a highly representative counterfactual for the treatment group to obtain reliable results. The selection of treatment and control groups is carried out based on their similarity, followed by the use of advanced synthetic control methods. It is worth noting that this method has gained traction compared to others, such as Difference-in-Differences. However, this method can produce biased results if a representative counterfactual is not constructed. For this reason, a robust synthetic control method for the counterfactual will be implemented in this case.
