This guide constains an overview of Package Murray, as well as instructions for your used.

## Experimental Design 

### 1. Upload data

First, you need to read data with Pandas:

```
data = pd.read(data.csv)
```

#### Cleaned data
After, if is neccesary, you can use the fuctions ```cleaned_data ``` where you add the data, name of target column, name of location and date columns. For example:

```
data = cleaned_data(data,col_target='sessions',col_locations='location',col_dates='date')
```

The fuctions will clean and plot tha data.



### 2. Experimental desing

Finally, you just to need running the ```run_geo_analysis``` fuction which is the main fuction for get the results.

The parameters needed to run this function are:

* ```data```: A data frame containing historical conversions by locations. This parameters must cotain a ```location``` column, ```time``` column and ```Y``` column. This columns get after to run ```cleaned_fuction``` or add the data manually with these feactures. 

* ```excluded_states```: A list of states to exclude from treatment groups. These states will no be include in the treatment groups, but these can be include in the control groups. 

* ```significance_level```: A number which is a significance level, that is mean, with ```significance_level=0.1``` you have a 90% confidence level in your results.

* ```deltas_range```: This parameter contains a range of different lifts. You can agg the minimum lift, maximum lift and the steps. For example, if ```deltas_range = (0.01, 0.3, 0.02)``` so the lifts will from 1% until 30% with 2% increments.

* ```periods_range```: A list constain a range of differents periods. This one is very parameter before. You can agg the minimum period, maximum period and the steps. For example, if ```periods_range = (5, 40, 5)``` so the lifts will from 5 days until 40 days with 5 days of increments.




``` py 
geo_test = run_geo_analysis(
    data = data,
    excluded_states = {'mexico city', 'm√©xico'},
    significance_level = 0.1,
    deltas_range = (0.01, 0.3, 0.02),
    periods_range = (5, 45, 5)
)

```


The results of the test provide us a visualization about the sensitivity in all periods admitted and differents holdouts. The holdouts depend of the data and locations, by default the number of treatment locations is 20% until 50% of total of locations. For example, if you have 32 locations, the range of size of treatment groups is 6-16 locations. 



### 3. Results

This section shows functions to display the experiment results, such as the treatment and control locations, as well as metrics like MAE (Mean Absolute Error) and MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error).

#### Impact graph

You can get a graph about lift, point difference and cumulative effect with the ```plot_impact()``` function. The parameters for run are:

* ```geo_test```: Results of the main function (```run_geo_analysis```).

* ```holdout_percentage```: The number of holdout percentage, this number you can see in the heatmap of the ```run_geo_analysis``` function.

* ```top_n```: Number of cases with the higher MDE values to plot. 


```py 
plot_impact(geo_test,periodo_especifico=10,top_n=1)
```




#### Treatment and control groups

For can get the treatment and control groups, you must run ```print_locations()``` function, this one print the treatment and control group you choose. The parameters needed to run are:

* ```geo_test```: Results of the main function (```run_geo_analysis```).

* ```holdout_percentage```: The number of holdout percentage, this number you can see in the heatmap of the ```run_geo_analysis``` function.



```py
print_locations(geo_test,holdout_percentage=85.75)
```



#### Weights

Murry can print the weights of the control locations that built the counterfactual, you just must run ```print_weighs()```. The parameters is the same that ```print_locations()``` function. For example:


```py 
print_weights(geo_test,holdout_percentage=85.75)
```
