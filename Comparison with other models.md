# Murray vs. Other Models


## Geographic experiments
As time progresses, advertising evolves, and consumer privacy increases. This is where the importance of geographic experiments arises, as they use measurement techniques based on models and data aggregation to help determine the true lift. 

Currently, there are many geo-testing models available in the market, such as Geolift and GeoX. However, Murray stands out as an efficient and accurate model. Additionally, Murray can generate all possible results based on the available data.

Next, we discuss the strengths and weaknesses of Geolift and GeoX.

### Geolift

An open-source solution by Meta designed to calculate lift across geographic areas. It leverages advancements in synthetic control methods, eliminating the bias generated by inaccurate comparisons between control and treatment groups, offering reliable results for geographic experimentation. This includes data ingestion, market selection, and inference, helping to support decision-making based on incremental impact.

Geolift provides a comprehensive solution, allowing users to obtain a wide variety of results. Additionally, its open-source nature ensures transparency and reproducibility.



### GeoX

It uses a linear model to predict counterfactual time series. It is positioned as a more robust solution for market studies based on paired comparisons and stands out for its superior properties when dealing with small samples (a reduced number of test/control markets).

## Limitations

When using some of the previous packages, certain limitations or issues have been encountered. While both Geolift and GeoX provide reliable and comprehensive results, it is necessary to understand their parameters to properly configure a suitable simulation for your data. Without this understanding, there is a high likelihood of "wasting time" and, in some cases, incurring elevated computational costs depending on the experiment size.

Moreover, once improvements in the results are achieved through better parameter configuration, it is also essential to understand these parameters. Since different metrics are considered to select the best ones, the user must account for all of this and prioritize specific parameters based on their needs. 

## Murray

Based on the limitations or problems outlined above, Murray was built from the need to achieve solid results that are easy for users to handle. While there are other significant models, as previously mentioned, they often require prior knowledge for parameter selection and result interpretation, leading to higher computational and time costs. For this reason, it was designed to eliminate these issues, providing a Python-based package that allows users to identify the most sensitive groups to treatments across different configurations of uplifts and applied periods. This approach gives users a comprehensive overview of different scenarios regarding where and how long to apply a treatment, ultimately reducing the time required for such analysis.

The package focuses on obtaining important metrics such as the Minimum Detectable Effect (MDE), leveraging advanced synthetic control methods to generate robust counterfactuals, ensuring reliable and solid results.

## Conclusions

Although Murray is a new product in the market, it introduces key features for geographic experiments. It is a user-friendly package, suitable for any user, and offers a highly viable solution for identifying the best combinations of locations and periods to apply treatments. The results are presented in a simple and understandable way, without the need to optimize parameter configurations for your experiments. This enables a comprehensive overview of different scenarios when applying a treatment, with the confidence of relying on the results obtained through robust techniques from synthetic control methods to generate a representative counterfactual for the treatment group.
